-----------------------

### Purpose: 

The scripts in this repository are for processing and ploting ROS data collected from diverse citrus species and relative after treatment with different MAMPs and mining, analyzing, and plotting chitin perceving LYK5 and CERK1 homologs. 


There is one main script that controls several scripts in this repository. To run each script, open Master_Script.R and run through each script (numbered 01 through 10) as well as the command line operations. 



#### To make final figure:

For the figures made here, some minor asthetic changes were made in a vector based software. These changes are noted in the scripts which make the preliminary 'final' figure and such figure can be found in the Final_Figures folder.

Any questions, feel free to contact me (Danielle Stevens) at dmstev@ucdavis.edu.
