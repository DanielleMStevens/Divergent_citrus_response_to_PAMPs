Purpose: The scripts in this repository are for processing and ploting ROS data collected from diverse citrus species and relative after treatment with different MAMPs. 


There is one main script that controls several scripts in this repository.  



To run scripts, in the R console, run the following command:
```R
source("./Master_Script.R")

```
